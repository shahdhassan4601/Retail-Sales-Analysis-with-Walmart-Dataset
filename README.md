# Retail-Sales-Analysis-with-Walmart-Dataset

# Introduction
In today's competitive retail world, figuring out how to sell the most stuff is a big deal. Walmart, one of the biggest retail chains out there, has to constantly figure out how to sell more in its stores. In this project, we're going to look at a bunch of data from Walmart's stores to see if we can find any patterns or insights that might help them sell more.

# The Challenge
Selling stuff isn't easy. There are lots of things that can affect how much a store sells, like where it's located, what time of year it is, and even things like holidays. Walmart has to deal with all these things to try to sell as much as possible. We're going to try to help them out by looking at their sales data and trying to understand what's going on.

# Problem Statement
Against this backdrop, our analysis seeks to address several key questions that are central to understanding and optimizing sales performance in Walmart retail stores:

1. Which store has maximum sales?
2. Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot?
3. Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays that have higher sales than the mean sales in the non-holiday season for all stores together.
4. Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights.
5. Plot the relations between weekly sales vs. other numeric features and give insights.

# Dataset Description
Walmart runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of all, which are the Super Bowl, Labour Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks. Part of the challenge presented by this assignment is modeling the effects of markdowns on these holiday weeks in the absence of complete/ideal historical data. Historical sales data for 45 Walmart stores located in different regions are available.

This is the historical data that covers sales from 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01, in which you will find the following fields:

- Store - the store number
- Date - the week of sales
- Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store
- Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 – Holiday week 0 – Non-holiday week
- Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale
- Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region
- CPI – Prevailing consumer price index
- Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate
